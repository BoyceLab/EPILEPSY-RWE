Welcome to the **Epilepsy-RWE Knowledge Hub**.  
This site brings together resources, methods, and publications to support the use of real-world evidence (RWE) in epilepsy research. Our goal is to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration by providing a centralized space for:  

- Understanding how epilepsy data sets can be transformed into the **OMOP Common Data Model**.  
- Learning about methods such as the **STARDUSTT approach** for structuring analyses.  
- Accessing tools and resources developed by the **OHDSI** community.  
- Exploring selected publications and ongoing projects led by our collaborators.  

This project is an initiative of the **[International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Big Data Commission](https://www.ilae.org/about-ilae/committees-task-forces-and-advisory-commissions/big-data-commission)**, which is dedicated to advancing epilepsy research through the use of large-scale data resources and international collaboration.  

We invite clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to use these materials as a foundation for further studies and to join the effort of advancing data-driven epilepsy research.
