## üóÇÔ∏è Commonly Used CDM Tables Overview

The OMOP common data model (CDM) is a relational database made up of different tables that relate to each other by foreign keys (XXXX_ID values; e.g., PERSON_ID or PROVIDER_ID). The OMOP tables in your data export are as follows:

| Table                | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Person**           | Contains basic demographic information describing a participant, including biological sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity. |
| **Visit_occurrence** | Captures encounters with healthcare providers or similar events. Contains the type of visit a person has (outpatient care, inpatient care, or long-term care), as well as the date and duration information. Rows in other tables can reference this table, for example, condition_occurrences related to a specific visit. |
| **Condition_occurrence** | Indicates the presence of a disease or medical condition stated as a diagnosis, a sign, or symptom, which is either observed by a provider or reported by the patient. |
| **Drug_exposure**    | Captures records about the utilization of a medication. Drug exposures include prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vaccines, and large-molecule biologic therapies. Radiological devices ingested or applied locally do not count as drugs. Drug exposure is inferred from clinical events associated with orders, prescriptions written, pharmacy dispensing, procedural administrations, and other patient-reported information. |
| **Measurement**      | Contains both orders and results of a systematic and standardized examination or testing of a participant or participant's sample, including laboratory tests, vital signs, quantitative findings from pathology reports, etc. |
| **Procedure_occurrence** | Contains records of activities or processes ordered by or carried out by a healthcare provider on the patient to have a diagnostic or therapeutic purpose. |
| **Observation**      | Captures clinical facts about a person obtained in the context of an examination, questioning, or a procedure. Any data that cannot be represented by another domain, such as social and lifestyle facts, medical history, and family history, are recorded here. |
| **Device_exposure**  | Captures information about a person's exposure to a foreign physical object or instrument which is used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Devices include implantable objects, blood transfusions, medical equipment and supplies, other instruments used in medical procedures, and material used in clinical care. |
| **Death**            | Contains the clinical events surrounding how and when a participant dies. |

## üõ†Ô∏è ETL Steps

1. **Dataset profiling and documentation**
   - Create data model documentation, sample data, data dictionaries, code lists, and other relevant information (23-Aug)
   - Execute database profiling scan (WhiteRabbit) on source database
   - Prepare mapping approach/documents based on scan reports from database profiling scan

2. **Generation of the ETL Design**
   - Mapping workshop with all relevant parties to:
     1. Understand the source
     2. Define the scope of source data to be transformed
     3. Define acceptance criteria for OMOP output  
     **Output:** draft mapping document
   - Finalize mapping document:
     - Integrate all notes/documentation from workshop
     - Work through mappings and verify, update, fill in gaps
     - Meetings/emails with data contact/technical contact (TC) as needed

3. **Source Data Integrations and Semantic Mapping**
   - Source Code mapping:
     - Identify which codes are already mapped to standard vocabulary
     - Identify code types for codes that need to be mapped
     - Translation of code description/phrases to English, if/as needed
     - Create proposed code mappings
   - Generate mappings for data coming out of flowsheets (together with consortium)
   - Review/approval of code mappings (often by medical experts with the Data Owner)
   - Identify imaging & waveform data; map using consortium-defined guidelines
   - Use OHNLP to extract OMOP data from unstructured sources

4. **Technical architecture design**
   - CI/CD strategy & version control
   - OHDSI ecosystem needs & infrastructure design

5. **Technical ETL Development**
   - Implement ETL (preferred language/structure)
   - Update ETL based on testing/QA/feedback (8, 9)

6. **Setting up Infrastructure**
   - Deploy core servers and services based on (4)

7. **Install OHDSI tools**
   - Database server, Achilles/DQD/Ares, Atlas/WebAPI, RStudio Server, HADES, notebooks & other site-specific tools

8. **ETL Testing and Validation**
   - Test ETL on sample/dev data, then DO data
   - Verify & document QA
   - Submit Achilles/DQD/AresIndexer results regularly
   - Plan & manage ETL development

9. **Data Quality Assessment**
   - QA/Acceptance testing for mapping accuracy & completeness
   - Review & approval by Data Owner

10. **Documentation**
    - Mapping Documentation, Themis checks, and technical/transform documentation

11. **Project Management Throughout**
    - Organize tasks, milestones, and follow-up
