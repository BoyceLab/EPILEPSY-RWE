Big data research is everyone’s research—Making epilepsy data science accessible to the global community: Report of the ILAE Big Data Commission  
**Josephson, C. B., Aronica, E., Beniczky, S., Boyce, D., Cavalleri, G., Denaxas, S., French, J., Jehi, L., Koh, H., Kwan, P., McDonald, C., Mitchell, J. W., Rampp, S., Sadleir, L., Sisodiya, S. M., Wang, I., Wiebe, S., Yasuda, C., Youngerman, B.** (2024). *Epileptic Disorders*.  

A comprehensive review by the ILAE Big Data Commission aimed at demystifying how clinicians and researchers can engage with Big Data—including clinical, imaging, EEG, and common data models—in epilepsy research and care. It addresses practical, ethical, and equity-related challenges while showcasing the transformative potential of advanced data science methods.

Submission: Drug-Resistant Epilepsy Phenotype to OHDSI Phenotype Library  
**Spotnitz, M.** (2022). Submission of the drug-resistant epilepsy phenotype—recently published in *Epilepsia* and showcased at OHDSI Symposium 2022—for peer review within the OHDSI Phenotype Library. This computable phenotype was developed using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) to systematically identify patients at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) meeting consensus criteria for drug-resistant epilepsy (failure of two or more appropriate medication regimens). The submission included a detailed clinical description, phenotype logic, and aims to contribute a reusable cohort definition to the open-science community.
